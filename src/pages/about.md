Phishing attacks are regarded as one of the most effective and low effort tools hackers rely on to compromise cybersystems or leak sensitive data. Pharec aims to bring innovative (autonomous) cybersecurity products that improve safety of our daily digital interactions (e.g. make browsing more chill). We train your machines to read, see and analyze like a cybersecurity expert beside you.

End to end deep learning with both image and text data to train a highly accurate phishing detection model. The model has similar visibility (actually greater visibility) to a human and if trained correctly can learn skills of a cybersecurity expert. It is as if you have a cybersecurity expert watching over (helping) you at all times.

Check out the [GitHub model repo](https://github.com/alialdakheel/phareq-model) for more details.
