TLDR: Pharec is a tool to actively detect phishing web pages using machine learning (computer vision) tech.

Phishing attacks are regarded as one of the most effective and low effort tools hackers rely on to compromise cybersystems or leak sensitive data. Pharec aims to bring innovative (autonomous) cybersecurity products that improve safety of our daily digital interactions (e.g. make browsing more chill) using end to end deep learning with both image and text data to train a highly accurate phishing detection model.
